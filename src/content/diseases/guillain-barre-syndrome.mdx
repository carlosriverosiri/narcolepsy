## Overview

Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) is an acute immune-mediated polyneuropathy characterized by rapidly progressive weakness and areflexia. It is the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis in the post-polio era.

**Incidence:** 1–2 per 100,000 per year

## Variants and Ganglioside Associations

GBS is not a single disease but a spectrum of related conditions:

| Variant | Antibody | Ganglioside | Key Features |
|---------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **AIDP** | Anti-GM1 | GM1 | Demyelinating, most common in West |
| **AMAN** | Anti-GM1, Anti-GD1a | GM1, GD1a | Axonal, pure motor, common in Asia |
| **AMSAN** | Anti-GD1a | GD1a | Axonal, motor + sensory |
| **MFS** | Anti-GQ1b | GQ1b | Ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, areflexia |
| **PCB** | Anti-GT1a | GT1a | Pharyngeal-cervical-brachial |

### AIDP (Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy)
- Most common variant in North America and Europe
- Demyelinating pattern on nerve conduction studies
- Anti-GM1 antibodies in some cases
- Generally good prognosis

### AMAN (Acute Motor Axonal Neuropathy)
- More common in Asia, Mexico, South America
- Strongly associated with *C. jejuni* infection
- **Anti-GM1 and anti-GD1a antibodies**
- Pure motor (no sensory loss)
- Can be severe with slower recovery

### AMSAN (Acute Motor-Sensory Axonal Neuropathy)
- Severe axonal variant
- Motor AND sensory involvement
- Poorer prognosis

## The Molecular Mimicry Mechanism

GBS is a paradigm for **molecular mimicry**:

```
C. jejuni infection
       ↓
Bacterial LOS mimics gangliosides
       ↓
Immune response to bacteria
       ↓
Anti-ganglioside antibodies produced
       ↓
Cross-reaction with nerve gangliosides
       ↓
Complement activation
       ↓
Nerve damage → paralysis
```

### Campylobacter jejuni
- Precedes 30-40% of GBS cases
- Different *C. jejuni* strains have LOS that mimic different gangliosides:
  - LOS mimicking **GM1** → AIDP/AMAN
  - LOS mimicking **GD1a** → AMAN
  - LOS mimicking **GQ1b** → Miller Fisher syndrome

## Clinical Course

### Phases
1. **Progressive phase:** Weakness worsens (up to 4 weeks)
2. **Plateau phase:** Maximal weakness (days to weeks)
3. **Recovery phase:** Improvement (weeks to months)

### Red Flags (Respiratory Failure Risk)
- Rapid progression (&lt;7 days)
- Bulbar weakness
- Bilateral facial weakness
- Autonomic instability
- Inability to lift head from bed
- FVC &lt;20 mL/kg

## Diagnosis

### Clinical
- Progressive bilateral weakness
- Areflexia
- Nadir reached within 4 weeks

### CSF
- **Albuminocytologic dissociation:** Elevated protein, normal cell count
- May be normal in first week

### Electrophysiology
- Demyelinating features (AIDP): prolonged distal latencies, conduction block, F-wave abnormalities
- Axonal features (AMAN): reduced CMAP amplitudes

### Antibody Testing
- Anti-GM1, anti-GD1a, anti-GQ1b panels
- Positive in 40-60% of cases (varies by variant)

## Treatment

### Immunotherapy
1. **IVIg (0.4 g/kg/day × 5 days)** — first-line
2. **Plasmapheresis** — equally effective
3. **Corticosteroids** — NOT effective (unlike most autoimmune diseases!)

### Supportive Care
- ICU monitoring for respiratory failure
- DVT prophylaxis
- Pain management
- Physical therapy

## Prognosis

| Outcome | Percentage |
|---------|------------|
| Full recovery | 60-80% |
| Residual disability | 10-20% |
| Unable to walk at 1 year | 10% |
| Death | 3-5% |

### Poor Prognostic Factors
- Age >60
- Rapid onset
- Severe weakness at nadir
- Axonal variant
- Preceding diarrhea (*C. jejuni*)
- Need for ventilation

## The Ganglioside Map Connection

In the [interactive ganglioside map](/science/gangliosides/?view=autoimmune), you can visualize:
- Which gangliosides are targeted in each GBS variant
- How *C. jejuni* LOS mimics these gangliosides
- The relationship between GBS variants and the ganglioside biosynthesis pathway
