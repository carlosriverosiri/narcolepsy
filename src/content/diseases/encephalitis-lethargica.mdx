## The Epidemic That Vanished

Encephalitis lethargica (EL) — the "sleeping sickness" — appeared mysteriously around 1916 and caused a worldwide epidemic lasting until approximately 1930. It then largely disappeared, leaving behind one of medicine's greatest unsolved mysteries.

### The Scale
- **Estimated cases:** 1 million+ worldwide
- **Mortality:** ~30% during acute phase
- **Post-encephalitic parkinsonism:** ~30% of survivors
- **Victims:** Famously depicted in Oliver Sacks' book *Awakenings*

## Clinical Features

### Acute Phase

The disease had three main forms:

| Form | Features |
|------|----------|
| **Somnolent-ophthalmoplegic** | Profound sleepiness + eye paralysis (most common) |
| **Hyperkinetic** | Agitation, chorea, tics |
| **Amyostatic-akinetic** | Rigidity, bradykinesia |

### The Somnolent-Ophthalmoplegic Form

This form is strikingly similar to Bickerstaff encephalitis:
- Patients slept for 20+ hours per day
- When awakened, often lucid ("awake but not aware")
- Complete paralysis of eye movements
- Fever, headache

### Post-Encephalitic Parkinsonism

Years to decades after the acute illness, survivors developed:
- Parkinson-like symptoms (rigidity, bradykinesia, tremor)
- **Oculogyric crises** — eyes involuntarily deviate upward
- Psychiatric problems
- Akinetic mutism

## The Influenza Connection?

The epidemic coincided with the 1918 influenza pandemic, leading to speculation that EL was caused by the influenza virus. However:

**Arguments for influenza:**
- Temporal association with 1918 pandemic
- Both caused encephalitic complications
- Some cases followed respiratory illness

**Arguments against:**
- EL cases appeared before and after the flu pandemic
- Influenza virus never isolated from EL brains
- Different geographic distributions
- Modern molecular studies found no influenza in preserved EL brain tissue

> **Current consensus:** The cause remains unknown. EL was likely an autoimmune disorder triggered by an unidentified pathogen.

## Relation to Bickerstaff Encephalitis

When Bickerstaff described his cases in 1951, he specifically noted the similarity to encephalitis lethargica. The key differences:

| Feature | Encephalitis Lethargica | Bickerstaff Encephalitis |
|---------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Era | 1916-1930 (epidemic) | Sporadic, ongoing |
| Hypersomnia | ✓✓✓ | ✓✓ |
| Ophthalmoplegia | ✓✓✓ | ✓✓✓ |
| Cause | Unknown | Post-infectious (C. jejuni, etc.) |
| Antibody | Unknown | **Anti-GQ1b** (65-75%) |
| Parkinsonism | Common (years later) | Rare |
| Treatment response | None (historical) | **IVIg/plasmapheresis work!** |

## Modern Implications

### Could EL Happen Again?

Sporadic cases resembling EL are still reported occasionally. Modern investigation usually reveals:
- Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis
- Bickerstaff encephalitis (anti-GQ1b)
- Other autoimmune encephalitides

### The Anti-Basal Ganglia Hypothesis

Some researchers propose that historical EL was an autoimmune disorder targeting basal ganglia, possibly triggered by streptococcal infection (similar to Sydenham's chorea). Anti-basal ganglia antibodies have been found in some modern "EL-like" cases.

## Connection to Narcolepsy Hypothesis

Encephalitis lethargica is relevant to the narcolepsy hypothesis because:

1. **Anatomical overlap:** Both EL and narcolepsy involve damage to the hypothalamus/brainstem sleep-wake centers
2. **Post-infectious trigger:** EL (like post-vaccination narcolepsy) followed an infectious/immune trigger
3. **Hypersomnia phenotype:** The profound sleepiness of EL resembles severe narcolepsy
4. **Possible autoimmune mechanism:** Both may involve antibodies targeting sleep-regulating neurons

The key question: **Were the same neural populations damaged in EL and narcolepsy?**

## Historical Note

Constantin von Economo, who first described EL in 1917, made a crucial observation: the lesions were concentrated in the **posterior hypothalamus and midbrain** — the very regions we now know contain:
- Hypocretin/orexin neurons (narcolepsy)
- The reticular activating system (arousal)
- Substantia nigra (parkinsonism)
