        <h2>Epidemiological Evidence</h2>
        <p>
          The association between Pandemrix and narcolepsy was first identified in Nordic countries 
          and has since been confirmed worldwide. Key findings include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>6-13 fold increased risk of narcolepsy following Pandemrix vaccination</li>
          <li>Onset typically 2-8 months post-vaccination</li>
          <li>Primarily affected children and adolescents</li>
          <li>Association not seen with other H1N1 vaccines (Focetria, Celvapan)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Genetic Evidence</h2>
        <p>
          Nearly all affected individuals carry the HLA-DQB1*06:02 allele. While this supports 
          autoimmune etiology, the mechanism may involve linked genes in the HLA region.
        </p>
        
        <div class="key-concept">
          <div class="key-concept-title">The Neuraminidase Hypothesis</div>
          <p class="mb-0">
            Neuraminidase genes (NEU1-4) are located near the HLA locus. Variants affecting 
            ganglioside metabolism could explain susceptibility while being in linkage 
            disequilibrium with DQB1*06:02.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Laboratory Evidence</h2>
        <p>
          Several laboratory findings support the hypothesis:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>H1N1 hemagglutinin shows affinity for sialylated glycans including gangliosides</li>
          <li>Molecular mimicry between H1N1 nucleoprotein and orexin receptor 2 (HCRTR2)</li>
          <li>T-cell reactivity to H1N1 epitopes in narcolepsy patients</li>
          <li>Established precedent: tetanus toxin transport via GT1b</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Neurotracing Evidence</h2>
        <p>
          Extensive research on retrograde axonal transport demonstrates:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>GT1b-binding molecules are efficiently transported from peripheral nerves to spinal cord</li>
          <li>Intraneuronal injection produces more efficient transport than perineuronal application</li>
          <li>Antibody-antigen complexes can be co-transported</li>
          <li>Some tracers (like tetanus toxin) are released into CNS parenchyma</li>
        </ol>
