        <h2>Research Background</h2>
        <p>
          I am a neuroanatomist with over 20 years of experience in neuroscience research, 
          specializing in:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ganglioside biochemistry</strong> — studying the affinity of various lectins and toxins for gangliosides</li>
          <li><strong>Neural tracing techniques</strong> — extensive experience with retrograde tracers including cholera toxin and tetanus toxin fragments</li>
          <li><strong>Spinal cord neuroanatomy</strong> — mapping peripheral nerve projections to specific spinal cord laminae</li>
          <li><strong>Axonal transport mechanisms</strong> — understanding how substances move within neurons</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Relevant Research Experience</h2>
        
        <h3>Neurotracing Studies</h3>
        <p>
          My research involved injecting various tracers into peripheral nerves and tracking their 
          transport to the spinal cord. Key findings from this work include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Intraneuronal vs. perineuronal injection:</strong> Direct injection into the nerve 
            fascicle produces far more efficient transport than application near the nerve.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Differential release patterns:</strong> Cholera toxin remains in nerve terminals, 
            while tetanus toxin is released into the spinal cord parenchyma.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Antibody co-transport:</strong> Antibodies conjugated to tracers can be transported 
            retrograde, demonstrating that immune complexes can reach the CNS via peripheral nerves.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ganglioside Affinity Studies</h3>
        <p>
          I have studied the binding properties of various molecules to gangliosides, with particular 
          focus on GT1b — the receptor for tetanus toxin. This research provided the foundation for 
          understanding how H1N1 vaccine components might be transported through the nervous system.
        </p>

        <div class="info-box">
          <h4 class="font-bold text-blue-800 mb-2">Unpublished Observations</h4>
          <p class="text-blue-700 text-sm mb-0">
            Some of the key observations underlying this hypothesis come from experiments that were 
            never formally published. While this limits their citability, the findings were consistent 
            and reproducible across multiple experiments.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Why This Hypothesis?</h2>
        <p>
          The Pandemrix-narcolepsy association has puzzled researchers for over a decade. Existing 
          explanations based on molecular mimicry are plausible but incomplete — they don't explain 
          the route by which immune responses specifically target hypothalamic neurons.
        </p>
        <p>
          My background in neural transport mechanisms offers a unique perspective: understanding 
          how substances can travel from peripheral injection sites to specific CNS regions. The 
          "Axonal Highway Hypothesis" emerged from combining this knowledge with the epidemiological 
          evidence.
        </p>

        <h2>The Role of AI</h2>
        <p>
          This hypothesis involves multiple complex, interconnected fields: virology, immunology, 
          glycobiology, neuroanatomy, and genetics. Presenting such a multidisciplinary theory in 
          a comprehensible way has been challenging until now.
        </p>
        <p>
          AI tools have enabled me to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Organize complex information into accessible formats</li>
          <li>Create interactive visualizations of biochemical pathways</li>
          <li>Cross-reference literature across multiple fields</li>
          <li>Communicate the hypothesis clearly to diverse audiences</li>
        </ul>

            This website presents a scientific hypothesis. It is not medical advice and should not

            safety, not to discourage vaccination.
